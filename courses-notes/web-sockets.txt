What web socket is:
	
	full duplex bi directional communication

Send special header (initial handshake) switching from http to web socket.

alternatives:
	- polling (ajax request every n secs)
	- long polling (keep connection with server until response from it and reestablish the connection each time response comes)
	- server sent events
		not bi-directional. uses some eventsource api to send messages from server


web sockets is not compatible with REST

libs:
	SocketIO (fall back to long polling)
