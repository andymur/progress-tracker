Some Advantages of cloud

	CapEx vs OpEx

	no contractual commitment

	costs decrease over time

	reduced procurement delays

	shared responsibility model
	pay as you go

	flexibility
		- elasticity

	massive global infrastructure

	regions
	availability zones
	edge locations

	SaaS, PaaS, IaaS (XaaS)

	API emphasis

	RESTful APIs

Key Services of AWS

	Compute & Storage & DB & Networking components

	Compute

		Lightsail lighter version of EC2
		Lambda only for computing (instead of normal vm)
		Batch similar to lambda but jobs instead of functions

		Elastic Beanstalk is a paas 
		Serverless Application Repository is for Lambda

		Containers is an evolution of compute components

		Elastic Container Registry is a catalog for the containers
		Elastic Container Service for docker containers
		Elastic K8s Service for k8s

	Storage

		S3 is a big bucket
		EFS (elastic nfs for *nix machines)
		FSx for windows but it is umbrella term
		S3 Glacier for archives
		Storage Gateway 
		AWS Backup

	Database

		RDS (different relational engines)
		Dynamo DB (NoSQL)
		Elastic Cache (Redis & Memcached)
		Neptune (Graph database engine)
		Redshift (for data warehouse)
		DocumentDB (document db storage)

	Network & CD

		VPC (virtual private cloud) space for network components (ip subnets, routing firewalls, network interface cards)
		CloudFront for remote areas kind of CD
		Route 53 -- DNS service
		API Gateway make APIs globally awailable

AWS Management Options

	AWS CLI
	AWS SDKs
	Identity and access management (IAM)
	```aws configure``` to setup an access

Well Architected Framework (consider reading it)

	5 pillars:
		Operational excellence
		Security
		Reliability
		Performance efficiency
		Cost optimization


AWS Global Infrastructure
	Regions
	Availability Zones (number of locations?)
	Edge Locations (CloudFront)
	Regions -> Availability Zones

Multi Tier Architecture

	Scaling Approaches
		Vertical (not recommended for aws)
		Horizontal

Multi Tier Architecture on EC2

	Security group
	AWS market place	
	Auto Scaling Group
	VPC (virtual private cloud)

	Elastic IP addres is not free of charge but it's not chaging
	Placement group (to collocate instance)
	IAM account to rue it
	Elastice Inference (Additional CPU)
	User data (script to execute when it launches!)

Advantages Multi Tier design

	Fine grained management
	Decoupling
	Promotes multiple teams

Decoupling in Design

	Loose decoubling (no awareness about other components)
	"Black boxes"
	SQS (queuing), SNS (notification), API Gateway for decoupling

Simple Queue Service

	FIFO vs Normal Queue
	Normal queue no guarantees about duplication & order
	FIFO should have extenstion of fifo

	Message Group ID, Message Deduplication ID, Message Attributes (kind of tags)
	Can be connected with Lambda

Simple Notification Service
	
	SNS -> SQS
	PubSub model
	System to system messaging
	Here we have topics
	Subscriber (e.g. email), endpoint (e.g. email address)

API Gateway

	create, maintain and secure APIs
	HTTP API
	Websocket API
	REST API
	
Autoscaling

	Create autoscaling launch configuration
	Several metrics to use (cpu, network etc)

Load Balancing
	
	ELB
	Network balancer (TCP,UDP) vs Application balancer (HTTP, HTTPS)
	Internal or public


Choosing storage

	S3 (simple storage service)
	EBS (Elastic block storage) for EC2 vms
	EBS located within EC2 AZ
	EBS can be snapshoted
	EFS replicated FS for *nix or FSx for windows (possible to have for different AZs)
	

	S3 storage classes
	S3 is not a file storage rather object storage

AWS CloudFormation

	Create stack (providing teamplate)
	Give it a name
	
CloudWatch
	
	Monitoring tab (CloudWatch Metrics)
	Add/Edit Alarms (Conditions for triggers -> Actions)
	Create Dashboards
