Some Advantages of cloud

	CapEx vs OpEx

	no contractual commitment

	costs decrease over time

	reduced procurement delays

	shared responsibility model
	pay as you go

	flexibility
		- elasticity

	massive global infrastructure

	regions
	availability zones
	edge locations

	SaaS, PaaS, IaaS (XaaS)

	API emphasis

	RESTful APIs

Key Services of AWS

	Compute & Storage & DB & Networking components

	Compute

		Lightsail lighter version of EC2
		Lambda only for computing (instead of normal vm)
		Batch similar to lambda but jobs instead of functions

		Elastic Beanstalk is a paas 
		Serverless Application Repository is for Lambda

		Containers is an evolution of compute components

		Elastic Container Registry is a catalog for the containers
		Elastic Container Service for docker containers
		Elastic K8s Service for k8s

	Storage

		S3 is a big bucket
		EFS (elastic nfs for *nix machines)
		FSx for windows but it is umbrella term
		S3 Glacier for archives
		Storage Gateway  (???)
		AWS Backup

	Database

		RDS (different relational engines)
		Dynamo DB (NoSQL)
		Elastic Cache (Redis & Memcached)
		Neptune (Graph database engine)
		Redshift (for data warehouse)
		DocumentDB (document db storage)

	Network & CD

		VPC (virtual private cloud) space for network components (ip subnets, routing firewalls, network interface cards)
		CloudFront for remote areas kind of CD
		Route 53 -- DNS service
		API Gateway make APIs globally awailable

AWS Management Options

	AWS CLI
	AWS SDKs
	Identity and access management (IAM)
	```aws configure``` to setup an access

Well Architected Framework (consider reading it)

	5 pillars:
		Operational excellence
		Security
		Reliability
		Performance efficiency
		Cost optimization


AWS Global Infrastructure
	Regions
	Availability Zones (number of locations?)
	Edge Locations (CloudFront)
	Regions -> Availability Zones

Multi Tier Architecture

	Scaling Approaches
		Vertical (not recommended for aws)
		Horizontal

Multi Tier Architecture on EC2

	Security group
	AWS market place	
	Auto Scaling Group
	VPC (virtual private cloud)

	Elastic IP addres is not free of charge but it's not chaging
	Placement group (to collocate instance)
	IAM account to rue it
	Elastice Inference (Additional CPU)
	User data (script to execute when it launches!)

Advantages Multi Tier design

	Fine grained management
	Decoupling
	Promotes multiple teams

Decoupling in Design

	Loose decoubling (no awareness about other components)
	"Black boxes"
	SQS (queuing), SNS (notification), API Gateway for decoupling

Simple Queue Service

	FIFO vs Normal Queue
	Normal queue no guarantees about duplication & order
	FIFO should have extenstion of fifo

	Message Group ID, Message Deduplication ID, Message Attributes (kind of tags)
	Can be connected with Lambda

Simple Notification Service
	
	SNS -> SQS
	PubSub model
	System to system messaging
	Here we have topics
	Subscriber (e.g. email), endpoint (e.g. email address)

API Gateway

	create, maintain and secure APIs
	HTTP API
	Websocket API
	REST API
	
Autoscaling

	Create autoscaling launch configuration
	Several metrics to use (cpu, network etc)

Load Balancing
	
	ELB
	Network balancer (TCP,UDP) vs Application balancer (HTTP, HTTPS)
	Internal or public


Choosing storage

	S3 (simple storage service)
	EBS (Elastic block storage) for EC2 vms
	EBS located within EC2 AZ
	EBS can be snapshoted
	EFS replicated FS for *nix or FSx for windows (possible to have for different AZs)
	

	S3 storage classes
	S3 is not a file storage rather object storage

AWS CloudFormation

	Create stack (providing teamplate)
	Give it a name
	
CloudWatch
	
	Monitoring tab (CloudWatch Metrics)
	Add/Edit Alarms (Conditions for triggers -> Actions)
	Create Dashboards 


ECS
	Elastic Container Service for managing and orchestrating containers
	Amazon Elastic Container Registry
	Run them on EC2 or Fargate (Serverless)


Lambda

	Serverless compute
	Charged only for calls
	Create a function
	
Storage Gateway (???)

	Three products
		File Gateway
		Volume Gateway
		Tape Gateway

	VM implemented in your environment (between your env and AWS cloud infrastructure)

	File Gateway has interface for S3 also NFS & SMB (server message block) supported
		Cost effective way for storage for your prem vm

	Volume Gateway is mounting cloud volume to your devices
		Cached volumes (for active use) (AWS S3) Stored volumes (more for backup)

	Tape Gateway
		Cloud-based storage for tape backups (to Glacier / Deep Archive)


AWS Snowball

	AWS Import/Export -- old classic way to put your data to AWS
	Snowball is the secure efficient way to send your data to AWS

VPCs

	Virtual Private Cloud
	VPC dashboard
	VPC consists of: subnets, route tables, gateways, dhcp options, elastic ips, security groups
	Access via Internet gateway
	Network ACL is a firewall for VPC

Route53
	
	DNS AWS Service
	make sure you understand all type record types (DNS)


CloudFront

	Content Delivery Network
	(Caching and Edge Locations)
	Create a distribution

Self Managed DB Solutions

	(old school your own dbms)
	build ec2 instance (OS for your dbms) may be with AMI
	or create AMI out of your instance
		
AWS RDS

	variety of engines

Dynamo DB
	
	DAX (NoSQL DB, Dynamo auxilirator...cache near to your users)
	
Elastic Cache
	
	2Cache engines: Redic & Memcached

Redshift

	DWH solution (column based)

DMS

	Migration the data into AWs (Data Migration Service)
	inital migration
	ongoing replication (till the cut over)
	choose an instance, create migration task

DataSync

	not DB data (e.g. logfiles)
	(kind of rsync i.e. files sync)
	NFS <-> SMB
	Similar to Storage Gateway

Athena

	SQL against S3
	Serveless


AWS Glue

Macie

	S3 for sensitive information
	AI service which could categorize S3 data

Kinesis

	Stream information data in AWS
	Video/Data/Data Firehouse/Analytics on the streams
	Good for IoT
	

Secure Architecture

IAM

	Identity & Access Management
	Billing could be changed only with Root (normally not used)

	Create Users & Groups & Roles
	Creating user we specifty programmatic access & management console access
	Group is a rights container
	Roles are resources for access from other resources (for services)

Firewalls

	Network Secuirty Group's inbound & outbound rules could be firewall
	Network Security Groups connected via network interfaces
	Network ACL (VPC category)
	Network ACL is not statefull (apply inbound + outbound separately)
	ACL diff Security Group ???

AWS WAF

	Web based application firewall
	AWS Shild (anti DDoS)
	AWS Firewall Manager

AWS KMS

	Key Managment Service
	Key policies
	AWS Managed Keys
	Customer managed keys
	Custom key stores

	Can be used for example to S3 encryption
	ARN (amazon resource name)

Cost Optimized Architecture

AWS Organization

Billing Alarms

Cost-effective compute and DB

	Trusted advisor service
	Lambda instead of EC2
	S3 + Route53 for static websites (instead EC2)

EC2 Instance Purchase Options

	Launching (price on demand)
	Reserved (another option like a contract)
	Spot instance (bidding on compute capacity)
	
Cost optimized Network Architectures
	Billing section in FAQ
	Cost Explorer as a good tool

S3 Storage classes
	docs.aws.amazon.com
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/?id=docs_gateway



------- S3 Additional ------


S3 has

- buckets
	A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3

- access points

- objects
	Objects consist of object data and metadata (k,v pair)

- keys
	Amazon S3 as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version" and the object itself. One key for one object.

S3 API


-------- EC2 Additional -------


-------- Lambda Additional ------


------- Storage Gateway -------


-------- VPC Additional -------
